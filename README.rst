=========================
ownCloud development tool
=========================

.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/owncloud/ocdev.svg
    :target: https://travis-ci.org/owncloud/ocdev

This is a Python 3 library. Every pip and python command in the following code
samples should be, if needed, replaced by the appropriate command on your system (e.g. python3, pip3)

**Developer Info:**

To test your changes locally without globally installing the tool on your machine run::

    python3 -m ocdev COMMAND

inside the cloned folder.

The **-m** option tells python to run the **ocdev/__main__.py** file. This is needed to have working imports in both installed and local versions.

.. note:: If the library is also installed the installed version imports will be used and local changes will be ignored. **Make sure to uninstall the global version first before running the local version**!

Installation
============
If **Python 3** and **pip** are not yet installed on the system, install it from your package manager, e.g.::

    sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip

Verify the Python version using::

    python --version

If it outputs **Python 3.2 or lower** (e.g. on **Ubuntu 12.04**) you will **need to install jinja from your package manager first**, e.g.::

    sudo apt-get install python3-jinja2

On Ubuntu 14.04, python is sym-linked to python 2.x. you use **python3** to call **python 3.x**. If you want to use **python** to call **python 3.x**, you can edit the links manually in /usr/bin or::

    update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python3 10
    
Then install the tool::

    sudo pip3 install ocdev

For the **setup** command, **git** has to be installed.

Updating
========
To update the library run::

    sudo pip3 install --upgrade ocdev


Get the currently installed version
===================================

To get the currently active version run::

    ocdev --version


Configuration file
==================
After running ocdev for the first time a new config file called **.ocdevrc** will be created in your home directory and can contain the following values:

.. code:: ini

    [startapp]
    email = your@mail.com
    homepage = your-website.com
    author = John Doe

    [appstore]
    url = https://api.owncloud.com/v1
    user = john_doe
    password = john_does_password


Setting up a development environment
====================================
To set up your development environment run::

    ocdev setup core

or::

    ocdev setup base

If you use **base** the following additional apps will be installed:

* activity
* bookmarks
* calendar
* chat
* contacts
* documents
* gallery
* music
* notes
* news

If at least **core** is set up, you can use::

    ocdev setup <repositoryname>

to clone a repository from ownCloud organization. To see all available
repositories, click `here <https://github.com/owncloud/>`_

The following optional commandline options are available:

* **--dir**: sets the name of the owncloud directory, defaults to core/
* **--branch**: sets the branch which should be cloned, defaults to master
* **--type**: sets the type that should be cloned, ssh or https. Defaults to https since you need access to the repository to use ssh

For a more verbose output run::

    ocdev setup -h

Creating apps
=============

To create an app in the current directory::

    ocdev startapp MyApp

The following optional commandline options are available:

* **--author**: If not given will be read from ~/.ocdevrc or queried on the command line
* **--email**: If not given will be read from ~/.ocdevrc or queried on the command line
* **--version**: defaults to 0.0.1
* **--description**: sets the app description in the appinfo/info.xml
* **--homepage**: sets the author's homepage in the AUTHORS.md file
* **--license**: agpl or mit, defaults to agpl
* **--owncloud**: the minimum ownCloud version, defaults to the currently active version
* **--no-history**: if given, clones with depth 1 which is very fast and clones only the current status. This is not suited for development but may be desirable on your continuous integration server.
* **--output**: The directory where the generated files should be written to. Defaults to the current directory

For a more verbose output run::

    ocdev startapp -h


Starting a PHP development server
=================================
To run a PHP dev server you can run::

    php -S localhost:8080

ocdev provides a shortcut for this common task::

    ocdev server

The following optional commandline options are available:

* **--port**: defaults to 8080


Setting up a test instance for continuous integration
=====================================================
To set up a test instance for continuous integration (e.g. on Travis-CI) run::

    ocdev setup core
    cd core
    ocdev ci mysql

The following databases can be chosen:

* **mysql**
* **sqlite**
* **postgresql**

The script requires php to be available from commandline.
